The error indicates that the IAM role `arn:aws:iam::551061066810:role/service-role/AmazonBedrockExecutionRoleForKnowledgeBase_6g8wu` lacks permission to access the Bedrock embedding model `arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2::foundation-model/amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`. Here's how to resolve it:

1. **Check IAM Role Permissions**:
   - Navigate to the AWS IAM console.
   - Locate the role `AmazonBedrockExecutionRoleForKnowledgeBase_6g8wu`.
   - Verify its attached policies. Ensure it has a policy granting access to the Bedrock model, such as:
     ```json
     {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
             "bedrock:InvokeModel",
             "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2::foundation-model/amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0"
     }
     ```
   - If missing, attach or update the policy with the above permissions.

2. **Verify Model Access in Bedrock Console**:
   - Go to the Amazon Bedrock console in the `us-west-2` region.
   - Under "Model access," ensure the account has access to `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`.
   - If not enabled, request access by selecting the model and submitting a request.

3. **Confirm Region**:
   - Ensure the knowledge base and role are operating in `us-west-2`, as the model ARN is region-specific.

4. **Trust Relationship**:
   - Check the roleâ€™s trust policy to ensure it allows the Bedrock service to assume the role:
     ```json
     {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
             "Service": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
     }
     ```

5. **Retry Data Sync**:
   - After updating permissions, retry the data sync operation for the knowledge base.

If the issue persists, verify the knowledge base configuration in Bedrock to ensure it references the correct model and role ARNs. For further assistance, 
check AWS CloudTrail logs for additional error details or contact AWS Support.
